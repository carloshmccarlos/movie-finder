 Always read memory-bank/@architecture.md before writing any code. Include entire database schema.
 Always read memory-bank/@website-design-document.md before writing any code.
 After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update memory-bank/@architecture.md.
 Always use pnpm instead of npm.
 I will run the tests manually. Do not start next phase until I validate the tests. Once I validate them, open progress.md and document what you did for future developers, do not write tests information in progress.md
 write comments in the code to explain what you did
